# Code
All the python files should be documented. Although some files are better documented than others, so I suggest going through LSTM and GRU if looking for better understanding of the Machine Learning code.

The LSTM and GRU used a [CSV file](https://github.com/MarcCruzs/NSFREU2022-Mobility-Scooter/tree/main/CSV%20Files/Kaggle%20Driving%20Behavior%20Dataset) from a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/driving-behavior-dataset) on driving behavior.
