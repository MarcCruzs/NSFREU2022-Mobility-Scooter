# Code
All the python files should be documented. Although some files are better documented than others, so I suggest going through LSTM.py and GRU.py if looking for better understanding of the Machine Learning code. The RaspberryPiCode.py is what was used for the raspberry pi 4 and sensor hat to allow it to collect Accelerometer and Gyroscope X, Y, and Z axis.

The LSTM and GRU used a [CSV file](https://github.com/MarcCruzs/NSFREU2022-Mobility-Scooter/tree/main/Data/Kaggle%20Driving%20Behavior%20Dataset) from a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/driving-behavior-dataset) on driving behavior.
